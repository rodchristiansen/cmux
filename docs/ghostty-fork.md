# Ghostty Fork Changes (manaflow-ai/ghostty)

This repo uses a fork of Ghostty for local patches that aren't upstream yet.
When we change the fork, update this document and the parent submodule SHA.

## Fork update checklist

1) Make changes in `ghostty/`.
2) Commit and push to `manaflow-ai/ghostty`.
3) Update this file with the new change summary + conflict notes.
4) In the parent repo: `git add ghostty` and commit the submodule SHA.

## Current fork changes

Fork rebased onto upstream `main` as of March 12, 2026.
Current cmux pin: `fbd49738d8f77fb494883747d34c93e7226f6352`
Ghostty review PR: https://github.com/manaflow-ai/ghostty/pull/11

### 1) OSC 99 (kitty) notification parser

- Commit: `8ddf23287` (Add OSC 99 notification parser)
- Files:
  - `src/terminal/osc.zig`
  - `src/terminal/osc/parsers.zig`
  - `src/terminal/osc/parsers/kitty_notification.zig`
- Summary:
  - Adds a parser for kitty OSC 99 notifications and wires it into the OSC dispatcher.

### 2) macOS display link restart on display changes

- Commit: `61f26076a` (macos: restart display link after display ID change)
- Files:
  - `src/renderer/generic.zig`
- Summary:
  - Restarts the CVDisplayLink when `setMacOSDisplayID` updates the current CGDisplay.
  - Prevents a rare state where vsync is "running" but no callbacks arrive, which can look like a frozen surface until focus/occlusion changes.

### 3) Keyboard copy mode selection C API

- Commit: `fbd49738d` (Add C API for keyboard copy mode selection)
- Files:
  - `src/Surface.zig`
  - `src/apprt/embedded.zig`
- Summary:
  - Restores `ghostty_surface_select_cursor_cell` and `ghostty_surface_clear_selection`.
  - Keeps cmux keyboard copy mode working against the refreshed Ghostty base.

### 4) macOS resize stale-frame mitigation

Sections 3 and 4 are grouped by feature, not by commit order. The fork branch HEAD is the
section 3 copy-mode commit, even though the section 4 resize commits were applied earlier.

- Commits:
  - `91759257a` (macos: reduce transient blank/scaled frames during resize)
  - `1debcb135` (macos: keep top-left gravity for stale-frame replay)
- Files:
  - `pkg/macos/animation.zig`
  - `src/Surface.zig`
  - `src/apprt/embedded.zig`
  - `src/renderer/Metal.zig`
  - `src/renderer/generic.zig`
  - `src/renderer/metal/IOSurfaceLayer.zig`
- Summary:
  - Replays the last rendered frame during resize and keeps its geometry anchored correctly.
  - Reduces transient blank or scaled frames while a macOS window is being resized.

## Upstreamed fork changes

### cursor-click-to-move respects OSC 133 click-to-move

- Was local in the fork as `10a585754`.
- Landed upstream as `bb646926f`, so it is no longer carried as a fork-only patch.

## Removed fork changes

### no-reflow resize override

- Was carried as `015b822df`.
- Reverted in the fork as `1b008f5c1`, so the current sync keeps upstream resize reflow behavior.

## Merge conflict notes

These files change frequently upstream; be careful when rebasing the fork:

- `src/terminal/osc/parsers.zig`
  - Upstream uses `std.testing.refAllDecls(@This())` in `test {}`.
  - Ensure `iterm2` import stays, and keep `kitty_notification` import added by us.

- `src/terminal/osc.zig`
  - OSC dispatch logic moves often. Re-check the integration points for the OSC 99 parser.

- `src/Surface.zig`
  - Both the resize stale-frame work and the copy-mode selection API touch this file.

- `src/apprt/embedded.zig`
  - Embedded C API surface additions tend to overlap here when upstream changes surface lifecycle hooks.

- `src/renderer/generic.zig`, `src/renderer/Metal.zig`, `src/renderer/metal/IOSurfaceLayer.zig`
  - The resize stale-frame mitigation touches renderer internals that move often upstream.

If you resolve a conflict, update this doc with what changed.
